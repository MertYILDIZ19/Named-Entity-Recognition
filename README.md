# Named Entity Recognition

In this project, identification and categorization task of the key information(entities) in text has been done which is known as Named entity recognition (NER). An entity in here can be any word or series of words that consistently refers to the same thing. For the sake of the task, every detected entity is classified into one of 13 predetermined categories. The categories are Person (PER), Location (LOC), Corporation  (CORP), O , etc. and there are B,I,O prefixes where B- stands to indicate that the tag is the beginning of a chunk, I- stands to indicate that the tag is inside a chunk and O- indicates that a token belongs to NO entity or chunk. Therefore the categories are as follows: B-PER, B-LOC,…, I-PER, I-LOC, … , and O. For this task, as we were not allowed to use transformer based architecture, I have used a variety of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based models for sequence tagging. To get better performance, I have used Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), since knowing what words immediately follow and precede a word in a sentence, it effectively increase the amount of information available to the network and  improving the context available to the algorithm. And, I have seen as expected that BiLSTM was way better compare to simple baseline LSTM.
